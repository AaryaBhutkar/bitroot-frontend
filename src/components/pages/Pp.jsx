    <strong>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong>
  </p>
  <p id="f35389c2-2ff6-4907-b7a1-5bed3cecf0a5" className="">
    You have the right to:
  </p>
  <p id="6376e283-d9c1-46cb-9b29-08f0f54c4645" className="">
    <strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a
    “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the
    personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing
    it.
  </p>
  <p id="991d6e8f-8c5a-47c8-a586-cf2238edb8de" className="">
    <strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about
    you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold
    about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new
    data you provide to us.
  </p>
  <p id="16cb0c55-c865-44fb-924d-130c632c599b" className="">
    <strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to
    ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for
    us to continue to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or
    remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right
    to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your
    information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data
    to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to
    comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be
    notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
  </p>
  <p id="90629864-fb11-4e72-8f58-3c9929eae8ac" className="">
    <strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are
    relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is
    something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
    processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights
    and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your
    personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may
    demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your
    information which override your rights and freedoms.
  </p>
  <p id="dad0c1bf-84fd-41a4-adc2-487c21a9cd74" className="">
    <strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data.
    This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data
    in the following scenarios:

    <li style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
      Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you
      need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

    <li style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
      You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we
      have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p id="546a5c4b-117c-4fc6-bfbe-c4a16716090b" className="">
    <strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a
    third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your
    personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note
    that this right only applies to automated information which you initially
    provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a
    contract with you.

    <strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on
    consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the
    lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
    If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products
    or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you
    withdraw your consent.
